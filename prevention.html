                <li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
                <li><b>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</b></li>
                <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
                    <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.</li>
                    <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled
                        into
                        the lungs.</li>
                    <li>Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing
                        symptoms.</li>
